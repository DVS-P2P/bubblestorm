/**
 * The Query object automates the query-response process. Query assumes a pair of bubble types for
 * data and query. Query bubbles are managed by this class, while local storage of data has to be
 * handled by the application. When a query bubble is received, the query is passed to the
 * application that queries its local data store and and passes the results, if any, back to the
 * Query object. The Query object cares about the callback and the transmission of the results to
 * the querier.
 * <p>
 * This class should be preferred over a manual bubblecast/callback mechanism where applicable.

 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are created using {@link QueryFactory}.
