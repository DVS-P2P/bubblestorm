/**
 * This is the main class of a BubbleStorm node.
 * <p>
 * Use {@link BubbleStormFactory} to create instances of this class.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The class {@link net.bubblestorm.demo.BSTest} is a simple BubbleStorm demo application.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is a quick introduction to using BubbleStorm:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Initialize the BubbleStorm library using {@link BubbleStormFactory#init()}.
 * <p>
 * Optionally enable LAN mode ({@link BubbleStormFactory#setLanMode(boolean)}), which reduces
 * timeouts and increases the frequency of network measurements. This is particularly useful for
 * debugging.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Create an instance using {@link BubbleStormFactory#create(float, Address, int, boolean)} or
 * {@link BubbleStormFactory#createWithEndpoint(float, Address, EndPoint)}.</li>
 * <li>
 * Create (data) bubbles using the {@link BubbleMaster} methods (obtain via
 * {@link BubbleStorm#bubbleMaster()}).
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * {@link InstantBubbleType}</li>
 * <li>
 * {@link FadingBubbleType}</li>
 * <li>
 * {@link ManagedBubbleType}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Alternatively to using query bubbles directly, you can use the {@link Query} facility.
 * <p>
 * If you cannot use Query but need to deliver results, e.g., in a pub/sub use case, you should use
 * the Notification facility (see {@link NotificationFactory}).
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
