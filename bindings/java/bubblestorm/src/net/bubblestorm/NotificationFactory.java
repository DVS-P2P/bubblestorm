 * <li>Node A: create a notification receiver instance, see
 * {@link NotificationFactory#create(net.bubblestorm.cusp.EndPoint, NotificationReceiver.Handler)}</li>
 * <li>Node A: encode the call-back information (address, port, ...) and send it to Node B, see
 * {@link NotificationReceiver#encode(Address)}</li>
 * <li>Node B: decode the received notification information, obtain a notification sender, see
 * {@link NotificationFactory#decode(byte[], net.bubblestorm.cusp.EndPoint)}</li>
 * <li>Node B: send a notification, see {@link NotificationSender}</li>
 * <li>Node A: notification handler is invoked, see {@link NotificationReceiver.Handler}</li>
 * <li>Node A: (eventually) close notification receiver, see {@link NotificationReceiver#close()}</li>
 * </ol>
