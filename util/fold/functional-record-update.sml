(* Briefly, if you have a record { foo: int, bar: real, baz: word }...
 * fun updateRecord z =
 *    let
 *       fun from v1 v2 v3 = {foo = v1, bar = v2, baz = v3}
 *       fun to f {foo = v1, bar = v2, baz = v3} = f v1 v2 v3
 *    in
 *       makeUpdate3 (from, from, to) z
 *    end
 *
 * You can then update records with: updateRecord record (set#bar 1.0) $

         (* The user supplies us with these two functions:
          *   to f { a, b, c } = f a b c
          *   from a b c = { a, b, c }
          *
          * The goal is to create a family of functions like:
          *   f0 (f, z) a b c = f (z a) b c
          *   f1 (f, z) a b c = f a (z b) c
          *   f2 (f, z) a b c = f a b (z c)
          *
          * These functions are passed as arguments via selector:
          *   c3 g = g f0 f1 f2
          *
          * We can thus set g=from to get a record of functional updates.
          * Use the update function as: to (record, upd (from, z))
