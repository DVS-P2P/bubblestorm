(* Signals are an abstraction of a data line.
 * 
 * At any given time, a signal is either ON and provides some value type,
 * or the signal is OFF and provides nothing. A signal handler is informed
 * (possibly many times) of the current status of the signal line.
 *
 * Signal sources, for example a network read, modify signal state. To
 * achieve this, they must be given a signal with which to report state 
 * changes that correspond to the events they produce.
 *
 * Unlike competing approaches (eg libsigc++, kde, gnome, etc), the signal
 * is not created at the event source, but rather at the event consumer.
 * The reasoning behind this is that  a signal handler might in turn change
 * the state of other, previously defined, signals. By creating signal lines 
 * at the event consumer, a handler can only refer to signals created earlier. 
 * This means that the program execution itself is a topological sort of the 
 * signal handlers. It is thus impossible for an event cycle to appear.
 *
 * Of course, the preceding reasoning breaks down if signals setON signals
 * or if there is mutable state. Therefore, whenever possible avoid these.
 *
 * In the rare cases where a signal loop is desired, use the newLoop method
 * as it will protect against infinite recursion. Instead of firing the handler
 * immediately, it defers execution to an Event scheduled to fire as soon as
 * the current event handler completes.
