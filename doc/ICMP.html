		<h1>BubbleStorm: ICMP Support</h1>
		<p>
		Sending/receiving ICMP is problematic for two reasons:
		<ol>
			<li>It's not portable and we need to use low-level C system APIs</li>
			<li>On many platforms it requires super-user priveledges.</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
		The best solution (if possible) is access ICMP via direct C FFI.
		This is possible if users can do SOCK_RAW or the OS provides another
		way to access related ICMP (linux IP_RECVERR for example).
		If ICMP send/recv requires super-user access, we need a helper tool.
		The setuid method spawns child processes to gain the needed access.
		However, not all systems support setuid (windows). 
		Then we proxy over a daemon loaded with the required priveledges.
		</p>
		<p>
		If the ICMP support is not set up properly, you will get the message
		<i>"Unable to use ICMP daemon, ICMP support disabled."</i>.
		This is not a fatal error. ICMP support will just be disabled.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Setup on Windows</h2>
		<p>
		To use ICMP under Windows, you have to build and install the CUSP-ICMP-service.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Go to <i>Middleware/csupport/cusp</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				Run
				<pre>
> make
				</pre> or <pre>
> make cusp-icmp-svc
				</pre>
				to build <i>cusp-icmp-svc.exe</i>
			<li>
				Register service, needs administrator privileges:
				<pre>
> make service-install
				</pre>
				or
				<pre>
> sc.exe create CUSP-ICMP binpath= C:\...
> sc.exe start CUSP-ICMP
				</pre>
				<p>Note: <i>C:\...</i> has to be the full path to <i>cusp-icmp-svc.exe</i></p>
				<p>Note: The space after the equal sign is mandatory!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				To uninstall the service, run (needs administrator privileges)
				<pre>
> make service-uninstall
				</pre>
				or
				<pre>
> sc.exe stop CUSP-ICMP
> sc.exe delete CUSP-ICMP
				</pre>
			</li>
		</ol>
